# ROS 2 Aruco Marker Detection and TF Publisher

Welcome to the ROS 2 Aruco Marker Detection and TF Publisher repository! This Python code enables the detection of Aruco markers in ROS 2, computes their 3D positions, and publishes the resulting transformations as TF data. Aruco markers are commonly used in robotics and computer vision for pose estimation and tracking.

## Features

- Aruco marker detection and tracking using OpenCV.
- Calculation of 3D positions for detected markers.
- TF (Transform) broadcasting for ROS 2, facilitating integration with robotic systems.
- Visualization of detected markers on the input image.

## Prerequisites

- ROS 2: Make sure you have ROS 2 installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. Customize the camera calibration parameters in `aruco_tf_publisher.py` to match your hardware setup if necessary.
3. Run the Python script, `aruco_tf_publisher.py`, to start detecting Aruco markers and publishing TF data.

## Repository Contents

- `aruco_tf_publisher.py`: The main Python script for Aruco marker detection and TF publishing.
- `README.md`: This documentation file providing an overview of the repository and instructions for use.
